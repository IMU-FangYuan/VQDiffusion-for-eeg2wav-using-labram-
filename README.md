# VQDiffusion-for-eeg2wav-using-labram
We implemented an EEG2Wav model using VQDiffusion. The EEG features were extracted using the pre-trained model Labram.
This version of the code needs to be modified to run. The Embedding part of the Codec needs to be modified. You need to go to https://github.com/935963004/LaBraM to download the pre-trained model and put it in the project directory.The EEG signal data needs to be preprocessed according to the LaBram project.
